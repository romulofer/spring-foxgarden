//! Running "Run with Coverage" (Maven only) and parsing the resulting JaCoCo
//! `jacoco.xml` report into per-line hit/miss/partial marks.
//!
//! No `pom.xml` edits and no standalone jar downloads: `jacoco-maven-
//! plugin`'s own `prepare-agent`/`report` goals, invoked as bare plugin-
//! goal coordinates alongside `test` on one `mvn` command line, compute and
//! inject the `-javaagent:...=destfile=...` argument themselves and
//! convert the resulting `.exec` to XML — the same "just ask Maven for the
//! goal" approach `build_tools::command` already uses for `test`/`compile`,
//! extended to a plugin that isn't already declared in
//! the project's own `pom.xml`. Maven resolves and caches the plugin jar
//! (and its own JaCoCo agent dependency) into `~/.m2` itself, the same way
//! it resolves every other plugin any `mvn` invocation needs — nothing for
//! this app to download or manage.
//!
//! The line-status algorithm below (`counter_status`/`line_status`) was
//! decompiled from the real `org.jacoco.core.internal.analysis.
//! {CounterImpl,LineImpl}.getStatus()` bytecode in a genuine
//! `org.jacoco.core` jar, not assumed from the report DTD's attribute list
//! (which documents what `mi`/`ci`/`mb`/`cb` count, not how they combine
//! into a status): the overall status is the bitwise OR of the
//! instruction-counter status and the branch-counter status, so a line
//! with `mi=0` (instructions fully covered) but a split branch (`mb>0 &&
//! cb>0`) is still `Partial`, not `Covered` — an easy detail to get
//! backwards.
