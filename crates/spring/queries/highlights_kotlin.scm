; Minimal highlight query for checkpoint 1's fixed theme:
; keyword / string / comment / type / function.

; "break" and "continue" are deliberately excluded: they exist as literal
; strings in the grammar's grammar.js source, but don't survive as matchable
; node types in the compiled parser this crate ships (verified by bisecting
; each keyword through `tree_sitter::Query::new` individually — those two are
; the only ones left that fail with "Invalid node type"). A grammar.js
; literal isn't a reliable signal that a query can match it; check
; node-types.json (or bisect like this) instead of trusting the source.
;
; "reified" used to be on this exclusion list for the same reason — bare
; `"reified" @keyword` fails to compile — but grammar.js wraps it in its own
; `reification_modifier` rule (`reification_modifier: _ => 'reified'`), and
; unlike the bare literal, `(reification_modifier)` *does* compile and
; matches the same token (TECHNICAL_DEBT.md #3's "richer modifier-keyword
; coverage" candidate, ported via this grammar's node-type wrapper rather
; than Zed's `fwcd`-grammar node names, same methodology as the enum-entry
; fix below).

; `true`, `false`, and `null` aren't distinct literal node types in this
; grammar (unlike Java's `(true)`/`(false)`/`(null_literal)`) — they parse as
; plain `identifier` nodes, so the only way to single them out is by text.
((identifier) @keyword
 (#any-of? @keyword "true" "false" "null"))

; `it` (the implicit single lambda parameter) and `field` (a custom
; property accessor's own backing-field reference) are, same as above,
; plain `identifier` nodes with no dedicated grammar node of their own —
; `PLAN.md` Track 2's own "@variable.builtin-equivalent treatment"
; (`SPEC.md` §2). Reuses `Scope::Keyword` rather than a new variant, same
; treatment this file already gives `this`/`super`/`true`/`false`/`null`:
; all are "special, context-dependent identifiers," not ordinary variable
; reads. Matched purely by text, so an ordinary variable/parameter that
; happens to be *named* `it` or `field` would false-positive — an accepted,
; unavoidable limit of a syntax-only pass (no scope resolution here), same
; category of gap the `true`/`false`/`null` match above already has if a
; real variable were ever named one of those.

; Enum entries, e.g. `LOW` in `enum class Level { LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH }` —
; ported from Zed's reference (`(enum_entry (simple_identifier) @constant)`),

; per `tree-sitter-kotlin-ng`'s own node-types.json, `enum_entry`'s name
; child is a plain `identifier`, not a `simple_identifier` (verified by
; checking node-types.json directly, per this file's and
; TECHNICAL_DEBT.md#3's own caution against assuming node names carry over
; from the fwcd grammar Zed's file targets). `(identifier)` as a direct
; child of `enum_entry` is unambiguously the entry's own name — the other
; possible direct children (`modifiers`, `value_arguments`, `class_body`)
; are distinct node types, so this can't accidentally match an identifier
; nested inside a constructor-argument list instead.
